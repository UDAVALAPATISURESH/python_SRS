                                           Python Polymorphism
The word "polymorphism" means "many forms", and in programming it refers to methods/functions/operators with
the same name that can be executed on many objects or classes.

                                           Function Polymorphism
An example of a Python function that can be used on different objects is the len() function.

                                            Class Polymorphism
=> Polymorphism is often used in Class methods, where we can have multiple classes with the same method name.
=> For example, say we have three classes: Car, Boat, and Plane, and they all have a method called move():

                                           Inheritance Class Polymorphism
What about classes with child classes with the same name? Can we use polymorphism there?
