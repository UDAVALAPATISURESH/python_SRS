                           Python Inheritance
* Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
=> Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
=> Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

                                  Add the __init__() Function
* So far we have created a child class that inherits the properties and methods from its parent.
* We want to add the __init__() function to the child class (instead of the pass keyword).

                                  overrides
=> The child's __init__() function overrides the inheritance of the parent's __init__() function.
=> If you add a method in the child class with the same name as a function in the parent class, the inheritance of the
parent method will be overridden.
