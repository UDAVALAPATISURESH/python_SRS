                          Tuple Methods:

* Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
* Unchangeable :Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.
* Index : Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc
* Tuple Length : To determine how many items a tuple has, use the len() function:
* Data Types  : Tuple items can be of any data type:
* count()	Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple
* index()	Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found

* type()  : From Python's perspective, tuples are defined as objects with the data type 'tuple':

* Negative Indexing : Negative indexing means start from the end. (-1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.)

* Change Tuple Values : Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.
But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.

* Unpacking a Tuple : When we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it. This is called "packing" a tuple:
* packing a Tuple   : But, in Python, we are also allowed to extract the values back into variables. This is called "unpacking":
*Using Asterisk* : If the number of variables is less than the number of values, you can add an * to the variable name and the values will be assigned to the variable as a list:
                              Tuple
> Ordered : Tuples are part of sequence data types, which means they hold
